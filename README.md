# Double Linked List
Double linked list is a type of data structure that is made up of nodes that are created using self referential structures. Each of these nodes contain three parts, namely the data and the reference to the next list node and the reference to the previous list node.

Only the reference to the first list node is required to access the whole linked list. This is known as the head. The last node in the list points to nothing so it stores NULL in that part. Also the doubly linked list can be traversed in both directions as each node points to its previous and next node.

This program shows the implemention of Double Linked List.
